## **Performance Metrics and Results**  

### **Model Metrics**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** *1.1080*  
  - Reflects minimal average squared deviation between predicted and actual marks, indicating a strong model fit.  
- **R-squared (RÂ²):** *95.14%*  
  - Demonstrates that 95.14% of the variance in student marks is explained by study hours.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** *0.8781*  
  - Indicates an average deviation of less than 1 mark between predictions and actual values.  

### **Accuracy Overview**  
- **Training Accuracy:** *95.89%*  
  - Highlights effective learning from the training dataset, with minimal risk of overfitting.  
- **Testing Accuracy:** *95.14%*  
  - Confirms the model's ability to generalize well on unseen data, ensuring reliable predictions.
